# Dicee-Game

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this project. 
This page generates images of two dice that belong to Player-1 and Player-2.
Each time the page is refreshed, a random number is generated and the image corresponding to that number is shown for each player.
This way, one can determine which player has won the game.
